# About

Passionate about optimizing code and producing high-quality, scalable products that deliver delightful user experiences.
Innovative hands-on collaborator, offering multilingual capabilities in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.
With extensive experience interacting with clients, I know how to prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and expertly bridge the gap between the customer and the dev team to deliver the right solutions. Dedicated and excited to continue learning within technology to resolve complex problems and contribute to corporate growth. When not coding you can find me on my bike with my dog, watching some ‘how-to’ video, gardening, or relaxing on the couch with my family.
